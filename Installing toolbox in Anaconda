This file contains a short description of how I installed the toolbox in my Anaconda environment.

After you have downloaded the files (or with creating a TortoiseSVN/GIT checkout), you have to install the toolbox using Anaconda Prompt.

Here you have to make sure that you are in the desired environment (when other than root). 
To see the working environment: conda info --envs
To change your environment: activate name_of_environment

Thereafter you cd to the folder above the file: setup.py (normally this would be the folder: xbeach-tools)

Thereafter you do: pip install -e xbeach-tools (so the folder above the setup.py file)

When received message of succes installation you should be able to use the toolbox.
